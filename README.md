# Project Overview
I implemented a simple compiler that generates A86 Assembly code for a sequence of expressions and assignment statements that involve +, *, and pow. 
- All expressions are infix expressions. 
- I assume that all values and results of operations will be 32 bit values, all numbers are non-negative integers, and an undefined variable has value 0.
- All constants are written in hexadecimal format. The leading digit of a hexadecimal constantis always a numeric digit, (for example: hexadecimal number abcd is written as 0abcd).
- There can be paranthesized expressions. Pow operation can accept expressions.
